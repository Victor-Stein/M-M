- 👋 Hi, I’m @Victor-Stein (or M-M for my acquantince), proud engineer and management enthusiast.  
- 👀 I’m interested in Business analytics and Data science in general. I also work on some mechatronics projects occasionally (new repos will be open soon).   
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Pandas, and several other libs for personal projects (ongoing development). Currently I'm still a beginner but wiling to work my way up to an advanced/experienced level.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analytics python projects (also open to R)
- 📫 How to reach me? Send me an email and I would get back to you as soon as I can !
